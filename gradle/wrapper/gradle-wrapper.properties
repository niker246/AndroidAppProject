#I use this line to load the gradle distribution from my local server. I do
# to save data and prevent the file from being downloaded every time you create a new one. The steps
# to do it are as follows:
#1- Install XAMP
#2- Look in the installation address folder called htdocs
#3- Within htdocs create a new folder named 'distributions'
#4- From 'distributions' paste the file 'gradle-6.3-all.zip' previously downloaded
#5- Change url 'https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.3-all.zip' to this
#'http\://localhost/distributions/gradle-6.3-all.zip'
